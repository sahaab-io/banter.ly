Banter.ly's goal is simply to be _the world's most comprehensive open source chat analytics ðŸ”Ž and visualization app ðŸ“Š_

We want to make it easy and safe for anyone to get the most advanced insights from their text conversations with the click of a button

See a live demo [here](http://34.105.74.179:8080/)

## Features
Banter.ly currently only supports Whatsapp chat exports - more messengers and formats are on the [roadmap](https://github.com/sahaab-io/banter.ly/projects/2) (feature requests and cool ideas are welcome!)

- Frequency analysis
- Sentiment, emotion, and profanity analysis
- Named entity extraction

## Getting Started

Banter.ly is built on top of [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/), which provides a fantastic python environment for creating dashboards

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)
- [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) running locally or one their free hosts

### Running the App

``` bash
# install poetry
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

# clone this repo and go into it
git clone https://github.com/sahaab-io/banter.ly.git && cd banter.ly

# create and activate the virtualenv + install dependencies
poetry install

# run the one-time setup script and download Spacy data
python setup.py && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# start the application
python index.py
```

If you don't wish to use [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as your package manager, a `requirements.txt` file **without the dev dependencies** is also included
